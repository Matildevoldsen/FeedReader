# FeedReader Testing

This game is a part of my nano-degree from Udacity.

The Feedreader contains a menubar with dynamic loading links to a new feed. Beside that there's a list of articles, tutorials, and blog posts.

This project tests everything from if the menu bar is clickable to the content has loaded.
